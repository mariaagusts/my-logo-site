    <h1>About me</h1>

          <p>
     I help teams untangle messy workflows, clarify information, and turn decisions into follow through.</p> 
      <p>Based in Iceland, working with clients locally and internationally. I take on projects, short engagements, or ongoing support.</p>
       <p>I have always been curious about how things work and how they can work better. That mindset took me from Economics at Harvard and Management Research at Oxford to roles across finance, operations, and business development.</p>
      <p>I also spent two decades in international football. It taught me a lot about preparation, teamwork, and staying calm when it matters. I bring that into my work: clear roles, steady progress, and practical solutions people actually use.</p>

    <h2>Who I am</h2>
    <p>
      I like to build things that work, whether it’s a process, a plan, or a sense of calm in a busy day.
      I’m straightforward, curious, and at my best when my work helps others move forward. Outside of work,
      life revolves around my two daughters, laughter, and the small moments that make everything else worthwhile.
