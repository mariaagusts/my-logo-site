    <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>Curiosity has guided most of what I do — from studying Economics at Harvard and Management Research at Oxford to years in finance and business development back home in Iceland. I also spent over 20 years playing international football for Iceland, an experience that taught me how trust, adaptability, and teamwork can turn challenges into progress. Today, I help businesses find clarity and structure in their work — often by simplifying what feels complicated.</p>

  <p>I like to build things that work — whether it’s a process, a plan, or a sense of calm in a busy day. I’m straightforward, curious, and happiest when what I do helps others move forward. Outside of work, life revolves around my two daughters, laughter, and the small moments that make everything else worthwhile.</p>
