    <h1>About me</h1>

    <p>
      I help teams in complex and regulated settings turn messy workflows and dense information into clear decisions and execution.</p> 
      <p>Based in Iceland, working with clients in Iceland and internationally. Projects, short engagements, or ongoing support.</p>
       <p>My career has been driven by a constant drive to understand how things work and how they can work better.
      That mindset led me from Economics at Harvard and Management Research at Oxford into roles across finance,
      operations, and business development in Iceland. </p>
      <p>Two decades in international football also taught me that
      high-performing teams succeed not by minimizing flaws but by recognizing individual strengths and aligning them
      toward a shared objective, an approach I now apply when turning complexity into clear, actionable solutions.</p>
    </p>

    <h2>Who I am</h2>
    <p>
      I like to build things that work, whether it’s a process, a plan, or a sense of calm in a busy day.
      I’m straightforward, curious, and happiest when what I do helps others move forward. Outside of work,
      life revolves around my two daughters, laughter, and the small moments that make everything else worthwhile.
    </p>
      <h2>What I help with</h2>
    <p>
     • Process mapping and simplification <br>
     • Documentation, templates and internal playbooks <br>
     • Icelandic to English translation and editing for business and legal texts <br>
     • Project coordination and delivery support <br>
     • Turning dense text or numbers into clear memos, slide decks, and spreadsheets <br>
    </p>
