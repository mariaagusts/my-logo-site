<h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am Maria, most call me Maja. I’ve always been curious about how things work, how ideas turn into action, and how teams find their rhythm. Growing up in Iceland, I chose to study Economics at Harvard because in a small, ever-changing economy, understanding how things connect feels almost essential. Later, my curiosity about people and behavior led me to Oxford, where I completed a master’s degree in Management Research, originally with the thought of pursuing an academic path.<br><br>
        Over time, however, that curiosity turned practical. Alongside my studies and career, I spent over 20 years playing football, including for the national team of Iceland, with years in the USA and Sweden. That experience taught me that while everyone is different, every voice matters, and each person’s strengths are unique in order to build something special. A team only succeeds when every contribution is recognized and valued, even those we might not fully understand at first. Lessons that apply just as much in business as they do on the field.<br><br>
        After many years in finance, operations, and business development, I now focus on helping small and medium-sized businesses bring clarity, structure, and teamwork into their daily work. My goal is to find simple, effective ways to organize, improve, and communicate, whether through practical consulting or translations from my native Icelandic, a language I’m proudly aware descends from the first Vikings.
