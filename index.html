    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I’m María. My path has been a mix of worlds — from playing football for Iceland’s national team to studying Economics at Harvard and completing a master’s degree at Oxford. After many years in finance and business development, I’ve learned that the best results often come from simple, practical solutions and clear communication.<br><br>
      Today, I work with small and medium-sized businesses, helping them streamline operations, improve organization, and communicate their message — in Icelandic and English. I offer hands-on consulting support, process improvements, and translation services that make it easier for companies to present themselves professionally across languages and markets.<br><br>
      I believe consulting doesn’t have to be complicated — it’s about listening, understanding, and working together to make things run more smoothly. My goal is to help businesses focus on what they do best, while I help with the structure, clarity, and practical side of getting things done.
